The Psychological Construction of Reality
-----------------------------------------
Do we share the same reality?
Perceptions are powerfully influenced by:
a. What we happen to be paying attention to
b. Contextual factors
c. Past experience
d. Expectations
e. Motivations and many other factors.

Change Blindness:
Change blindness is a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when a change in a visual 
  stimulus is introduced and the observer does not notice it.

Confirmation Bias
-----------------
It is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a 
  way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.

Consequences:
It can serve to preserve and strengthen social expectations.

Self-Fulfilling Prophecies
--------------------------
A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes 
  itself to become true, by the very terms of the prophecy itself, due to positive 
  feedback between belief and behavior.

Behavioral Confirmation:
It takes place when people's social expectations lead them to act in a way that
  causes others to confirm these expectations.
It is type of social self-fulfilling prophecies.

Beliefs will become reality.

Thin Slices: Social Judgements in the Blink of an Eye
-----------------------------------------------------
Social perception operate with surprising efficiency.
It is accurate when the judgements were based on thin slices of behaviour less
  than 5 minutes in length.

Social judgements can take place very rapidly, sometimes with surprising accuracy.
At the same time, they're prone to certain biases and distortions, and once our
  judgements are formed, we tend to lock into them.

What Other People Think of You
------------------------------
Social impressions are formed very quickly.
